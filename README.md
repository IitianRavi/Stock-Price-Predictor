## ⚙️ How to Use

1. Run the Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook stock_predictor.ipynb
   ```

2. Enter the stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, TSLA, INFY).
3. Define the date range.
4. The notebook will:
   - Fetch data via yFinance
   - Plot stock performance
   - Train a deep learning model (LSTM)
   - Predict future prices
   - Display predicted vs actual prices

## 🤖 Model Summary

The project uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model, which is highly efficient for time-series data prediction tasks. The model is trained using closing prices of the stock and optimized using Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function.

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Integrate with a frontend using Flask / Streamlit
- Deploy the app using Render or HuggingFace Spaces
- Add sentiment analysis using news articles or tweets
- Include multiple stock comparisons
